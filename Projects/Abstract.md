# Agape
This project was developed as part of my Software Engineering assignment. Throughout this module, I gained valuable insights into professional project planning and management techniques. 
Agape -  an application I designed and built specifically to assist new parents, offering guidance and support on their journey into parenthood. Its features and tools are tailored to address the unique challenges and questions that arise during this transformative phase of life. 


## Abstract
"Love is an unconditional commitment to an imperfect person…To love somebody isn`t just a strong
feeling. It is a decision, a judgment, and a promise." – Fromm, E. (2007). Art of Loving
The love a parent feels for their child is beyond words, but if it had to be described, unconditional is
the first word that comes to mind. Agape is a beautiful Latin word I discovered a few years back. It
describes love in its highest form, a term to convey affection without any conditions.
Unconditional Love; Agape. The most apt expression to capture the bond between a parent and their
child. Considering this, I dedicate my project to this very expression and named it Agape.
This application is developed to aid parents for guidance and support to their new set of paths of
upbringing a family. It contains features that will ease the day-to-day tasks, lessons and tips to gain
more information, availability to connect with other parents and a tool to capture memorable
occasions.
Agape is committed to guiding parents through the challenges of parenthood, empowering them to
lead a healthier, more organized lifestyle.
