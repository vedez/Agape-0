# About

The purpose of the Agape project is to develop a mobile application that adheres to the fundamental principles of software engineering. This application is developed to support new parents in managing the challenges of raising a family. By applying systematic methodologies, including thorough requirements analysis, feasibility studies, and user-centered design, the project ensures a reliable and efficient application. 
Agape offers a range of features such as AR camera and editing tools, parenting tips and lessons, a life passport for health information, customizable trackers, and playdate management, all designed with a focus on usability, security, and performance. Additionally, premium features like GPS tracking and geo-fencing enhance child safety. Through the application of software engineering best practices, Agape aims to deliver a robust and user-friendly tool that empowers parents, streamlines their daily routines, and supports a more organized and informed approach to parenting.

## Defintion behind Agape
"Love is an unconditional commitment to an imperfect person…To love somebody isn`t just a strong
feeling. It is a decision, a judgment, and a promise." – Fromm, E. (2007). Art of Loving

The love a parent feels for their child is beyond words, but if it had to be described, unconditional is
the first word that comes to mind. Agape is a beautiful Latin word I discovered a few years back. It
describes love in its highest form, a term to convey affection without any conditions.
Unconditional Love; Agape. The most apt expression to capture the bond between a parent and their
child. Considering this, I dedicate my project to this very expression and named it Agape.
This application is developed to aid parents for guidance and support to their new set of paths of
upbringing a family. It contains features that will ease the day-to-day tasks, lessons and tips to gain
more information, availability to connect with other parents and a tool to capture memorable
occasions.

Agape is committed to guiding parents through the challenges of parenthood, empowering them to
lead a healthier, more organized lifestyle.
